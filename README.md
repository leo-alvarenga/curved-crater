# Curved Crater

**Curved Crater** is a basic and small analytics REST API I created to replace the overhead of using full-blown services such as Google Analytics. Data persistency is done using a small SQLite database file, and it logs all events and analytics persisted on log files.

As of now, it only handles visit analytics, although the API is very extensible.
